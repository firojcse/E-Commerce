Now, it is the processors that are upgraded, and with Comet Lake-H, the new Nitro 5 (AN515-55) will try to assault the budget gaming market. However, it has a frightening competitor in the face of the ASUS TUF A15 (FA506) and its crazy Intel Core i7-10750H Processor (12M Cache, 2.60 GHz up to 5.00 GHz). Thankfully, Acer is planning on AMD-equipped laptops from the Nitro family, as well, but until that happens, we are “stuck” with what Intel has to offer. Despite all of the fuss about them, they proved to be a non-substantial upgrade over the Coffee Lake-HR CPUs, and they produce a lot of excessive heat. It is particularly interesting how the Nitro 5 (AN515-55) will counter this, especially when you consider the fact that its predecessor wasn’t the best in terms of cooling. Nevertheless, there are a couple of important features making a return, like a 60Hz display and RAID 0 support – something that is still rarely seen in the budget gaming laptop market."""

Thankfully, Acer is planning on AMD-equipped laptops from the Nitro family, as well, but until that happens, we are “stuck” with what Intel has to offer. Despite all of the fuss about them, they proved to be a non-substantial upgrade over the Coffee Lake-HR CPUs, and they produce a lot of excessive heat. It is particularly interesting how the Nitro 5 (AN515-55) will counter this, especially when you consider the fact that its predecessor wasn’t the best in terms of cooling. Nevertheless, there are a couple of important features making a return, like a 60Hz display and RAID 0 support – something that is still rarely seen in the budget gaming laptop market."""
